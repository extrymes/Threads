# Threads

I recreated the Threads application to improve my web development skills, particularly focusing on **React** and **Next.js**.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tech Stack

- For the frontend, I used **React** and **Next.js** to build a dynamic server-rendered application, with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **next-themes** for dark mode support.
- For authentication, I integrated **next-auth** to handle user sign-ins securely.
- For the database, I chose **MongoDB**, and I used **bcrypt** to encrypt passwords.
- To enhance user experience, I implemented **react-toastify** for notifications.
- The entire project is written in **TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.
